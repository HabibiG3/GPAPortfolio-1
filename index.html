  <p>
    My skills in sales have been developing for the last  years and it has ultimately taught me a skill that cannot be learned. 
    The ability to read people. I have learned that being able to see what works best and easiest for a client(s) only turns out positive results and creates a relaitonship that keeps them coming back for your product or service. 
    If a client is happy they will recommend friends and family to you or your company. Regradless, I believe I can take these skills and apply them to the web development world because i know what people will want 
    to see and interact with making the consumer experience nothing short of 5 star. </p>
